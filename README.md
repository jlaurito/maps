# geoJSON and topoJSON Map Repository

This is an informal, cobbled together collection of geoJSON and topoJSON maps.

Where the source is known, we've provided it, either in a metadata JSON file, or in the geoJSON/topoJSON file itself in an off-spec 'datasource' field.

If you have additional maps, please make a pull request.

Special thanks to [Marcin Wichary](https://github.com/mwichary) and the rest of the creators of [Click that Hood](https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood) for gathering a lot of maps and giving me permission to repost their work.
